The Calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week. An instant in time can be represented by a millisecond value that is an offset from the Epoch, January 1, 1970 00:00:00.000 GMT (Gregorian).
The class also provides additional fields and methods for implementing a concrete calendar system outside the package. Those fields and methods are defined as protected.

Like other locale-sensitive classes, Calendar provides a class method, getInstance, for getting a generally useful object of this type. Calendar's getInstance method returns a Calendar object whose calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time:

     Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();
 
A Calendar object can produce all the calendar field values needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language and calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional). Calendar defines the range of values returned by certain calendar fields, as well as their meaning. For example, the first month of the calendar system has value MONTH == JANUARY for all calendars. Other values are defined by the concrete subclass, such as ERA. See individual field documentation and subclass documentation for details.
